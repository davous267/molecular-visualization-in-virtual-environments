An important aspect of research in molecular visualization in an immersive virtual environment is the development of software tools and prototypes. Therefore, we also paid attention to the availability of software tools during the literature review. We list the number of tools available and focus on those that can be downloaded and tested. The purpose of this section is to address two types of readers. The first type is the reader who is only interested in the available tools that he can use and test for a specific domain challenge. The second type of reader is interested in developing a prototype for mixed reality molecular visualization. Therefore, we also discuss the options for the interested reader to start these prototypes, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of the available APIs and frameworks. 

We have found that the published work that appeared before the first consumer-grade MR headsets were available mostly used specialized hardware and specialized software, which made it difficult to spread the approach among interested researchers, at least it was only possible in certain niches. Later, the tools became more widely available as it became easier to test them on commonly available hardware, as described in the Hardware section. We found that the tools can be divided into two main categories. The first are extensions of existing desktop tools that provide additional immersive functionality. The second are tools designed exclusively for immersive devices. We encourage readers to take a close look at existing tools and see if certain desired functionality already exists.
