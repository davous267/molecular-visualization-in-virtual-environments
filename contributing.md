# Contribution Guidelines

To make this curated list as useful as possible, we encourage everyone to contribute.  
We (as well as the community) will highly appreciate that. :-)

## How to contribute?
The contribution should be realized via pull requests, as it is the most straightforward and manageable way.  
If you want to avoid forking the repository locally, you can modify the files & create pull requests [directly from GitHub UI](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files#editing-files-in-another-users-repository).  
As for the contribution itself, please keep in mind these rules:
- Before the contribution, ensure that the application is not yet included.
- Make sure that the text is formatted correctly (new items are part of a list, links work, etc.).
- Provide a meaningful commit message making it clear what is it you add & why do you suggest it.

That's it. :-)
